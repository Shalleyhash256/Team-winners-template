Identify the target users: Are you building for developers, designers, educators, or general teams?

Clarify the core features: Messaging, file sharing, task management, video calls, real-time editing?

Set goals: What problems will your tool solve better than existing ones?

🧩 2. Research and Planning
Study existing tools: Analyze strengths and weaknesses of platforms like Slack, GitHub, or Confluence.

Choose your collaboration style:

Real-time: Live editing, chat, video conferencing

Asynchronous: Comments, task boards, version control
